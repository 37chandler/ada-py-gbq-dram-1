# ADA: Python & GBQ with Dram Shop, Part 1

This assignment is the first of two uploading Dram Shop data to GBQ. In this assignment we'll read in
a single file into a Pandas dataframe, make some modifications to it, upload it to your GBQ instance, 
and query it. 

In the second part of the assignment we'll perform some more complicated manipulations and uploads.
