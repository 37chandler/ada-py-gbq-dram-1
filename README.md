# ADA: Python & GBQ with Dram Shop, Part 1

This exercise is the first of two where we work on uploading Dram Shop data to GBQ. In this exercise,
we'll read in a single file into a Pandas dataframe, make some modifications to it, upload it to your GBQ instance, 
and query it. 

In the second part of the exercise, which you'll receive next week,  
we'll perform some more complicated manipulations and uploads. 

Students doing the Wedge Assignment for an A are urged to complete both of these Dram Shop assignments.
