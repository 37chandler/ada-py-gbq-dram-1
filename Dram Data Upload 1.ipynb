    "## Dram Data Upload\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll upload Dram shop data to your GBQ account and run a couple of queries against it. The data for this assignment is in a .csv file callled `items-2022-01-01-2022-10-01.csv`. Save this file into the same folder as this repository. This is an example of item-level reports exported from the point-of-sale system at the Dram shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goals are to upload this file to a table in a GBQ data set that you create. Call the table `dram_items_2022`. \n",
    "As always, make sure _not_ to commit any big data files or API keys to your repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make your data pipeline idempotent, which means you will be checking for the presence of your tables and, if they exist, deleting them before recreating them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you'll use the `pyjanitor` package, which you can install with `pip install pyjanitor`. Then the `import janitor` call will run. This package, which is modeled on the `janitor` package in R, can be used to clean up names in a data frame. If you have a Pandas data frame called `df`, then `df = janitor.clean_names(df)` will give you nice lowercase names with underscores. You can learn more [here](https://github.com/pyjanitor-devs/pyjanitor). \n"
